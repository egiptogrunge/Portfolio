Portfolio of personal projects or projects in a learning context.

## SQL Server
Database creation for a hypothetical application suggesting nearby events to the user. The app was named "Bora Lá," and here it is included all the scripts for CRUD operations and a relational entity scheme.

## API Rest
An API developed in C# using Visual Studio, enabling connection to and editing of the database. It facilitates viewing, creation, deletion, and editing of records in one of the database tables (for proof of concept purposes).

## Angular App
A web application developed with Angular using Visual Studio Code, serving as the front-end for the "Bora Lá" project. It features a home page with a fake feed, an "about us" page, and pages for the previously mentioned API features (viewing, editing, creating, and deleting records in the database) for proof of concept.

## Power BI
A PBIX file containing extensive data analysis on gym data to gain insights for gym administration.

## Power Apps
1 - A mobile canvas app developed with Power Apps to manage gym machine maintenance and space cleaning. The users, gym maintenance employees, use the app to take pictures and activate toggles to indicate items needing maintenance.

2- A tablet canvas app developed with Power Apps for verifying gym conditions, similar to the mobile app. However, it's designed for use by employees with higher responsibilities, allowing them to create new users in the system, view lists of items needing maintenance, and confirm issue resolution.
